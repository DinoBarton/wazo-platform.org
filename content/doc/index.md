Wazo is an application suite based on several free existing components
including [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/), and our own developments
to provide communication services (IPBX, Unified Messaging, \...) to
businesses.

Wazo is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
Most of its distinctive components, and Wazo as a whole, are distributed
under the *GPLv3 license*.

You may also check the [Wazo blog](http://blog.wazo.community/) for more
information.

Wazo documentation is also available as a downloadable HTML, EPUB or PDF
file. See the [downloads
page](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wazo/downloads/) for a list of
available files or use the menu on the lower right.
