How can I donate money to the project
---

The Wazo-Platform project does not accept donations. We think itâ€™s a poor business model for running an open source project as it suggests the developers are working for charity.

If you want to help the project financially, you can approach some of the companies offering commercial support for Wazo Enterprise and engage their services. Doing so creates a healthy ecosystem around the project where companies are encouraged to contribute their resources to improve the project to create a larger pool of potential customers wanting their services.

We appreciate positive feedback on our project as well. If you are on Twitter, send us a tweet to @wazocommunity. That helps raise awareness of our project so others can benefit from it as well. Contributions to our blog or to the forum and organizing events around wazo-platform is another great contributions you can do.
