title: People Xlet features Upgrade Notes
---

When upgrading your XiVO to 15.19, there are some features in the
directories that could not be upgraded automatically, because it risked
breaking some manual configurations.

After you upgrade your XiVO, your CTI displays in
`Services --> CTI Server --> Directories --> Displays`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} may
look like this:

![](/images/uc-doc/upgrade/15-19/display_before_15_19.png)

You should update your displays to make them look like:

![](/images/uc-doc/upgrade/15-19/display_after_15_19.png)

This will give you a Xlet People looking like this:
