title: Enabling Chan Dahdi
---

`chan_dahdi` is not enabled on a normal UC engine installation. This page describes the steps that
are required to enable that functionality within Asterisk

## Install the required dependencies

The required dependencies to use dahdi are not installed on a UC engine at the moment of the
installation. If you wish to use dahdi on your system you will have to install the
`wazo-asterisk-extra-modules` package which depends on many shared libraries that are not used by
the default Wazo configuration:

```bash
apt update
apt install wazo-asterisk-extra-modules
```

## Add `chan_dahdi.so` to `/etc/asterisk/modules.conf` {#add-chan-dahdi-to-asterisk-modules}

The `modules.conf` file is auto-generated by wazo-confgend. To add `chan_dahdi.so`, the
`modules.conf` file use the following commands:

```bash
echo<<EOF >/etc/wazo-confgend/conf.d/chan_dahdi.yml
enabled_asterisk_modules:
  chan_dahdi.so: true
EOF
systemctl restart wazo-confgend.service
```
