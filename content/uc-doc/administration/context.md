## Description

The dialplan in Asterisk is organized into sections, called contexts. 

Contexts are the basic organizational unit within the dialplan, and as such they keep different sections of the dialplan independent from each other. 

Contexts can be used to separate out functionality and features, enforce security boundaries between the various parts of the dialplan, as well as to provide different classes of service to groups of users.
