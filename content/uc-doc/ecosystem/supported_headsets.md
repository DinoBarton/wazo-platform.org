title: Supported Headsets
---

There are a variety of headsets you can use to operate the web or the desktop version of the Wazo app. At this point, you can answer and hang up calls, as well as mute and unmute them.

## Jabra
We currently support Jabra devices through the implementation of their browser and desktop SDK.

## WebHID
Our headset support has been extended to include WebHID-capable devices, allowing for even more compatibility with the web and desktop versions of Wazo. Devices that implement standard telephony input and output reports should work seamlessly.

We've hand-tested several devices and can confirm their successful compatibility with Wazo. Here are a few examples:

- **Jabra**
  - Evolve 75 (Jabra Link 370 dongle)
  - PRO 930
- **Yealink**
  - BH 72 Lite Teams (Yealink BT51 dongle)
- **Poly**
  - Voyager 4220 UC (Poly BT600 dongle)

Please note that a Bluetooth connection to your computer will not work. To connect your headset, you'll need to use either a direct USB connection or a USB dongle.
